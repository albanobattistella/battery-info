## Requirements

- guile 3
- guile-lib
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.
  
## Icon attribution

For the icon i have used art from Adrien Coquet and Kidiladon.

## TODO

- refactor to remove global app variable
- extract gtk stuff to another file
- reload every second?
- create a web page
- translate to slovak
- deploy to flathub
- post to /r/linux and hacker news

- gi-object-show does not work on Gio.BusType enum?
- 
  This does not work, it halts:
  ```
  (use-modules (g-golf))
  (gi-import "GLib")
  (g-variant-new-string "hello")
  ```
  But with <code>(gi-import "Gio")</code> it works.
- g-variant-new-array is not possible to use?
- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation

- gvariants should be handled better:
  - two functions to convert between a variant and scheme value
  - accept scheme values in place of gvariant arguments.

- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.

- report selection bug, see select.scm
