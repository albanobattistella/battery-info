## Requirements

- guile 3.0
- guile-lib 0.2.5
  from http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/guile-lib/
- g-golf 0.8
  from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/g-golf.git
- gtk 4
- libadwaita 1.3

## Description

This is a guile program using g-golf library to access Gio, Gtk and Adw libraries.
Information is collected using UPower DBus interface
(https://upower.freedesktop.org/docs/Device.html),
with the *gdbus* client from *Gio* library.
User interface is displayed using *Adw* and *Gtk* libraries.

I would like to display number of cells, or nominal voltage to battery information.
This is not provided by UPower interface.
It may be guessed by the technology, voltage and state values.

## libadwaita 1.4

The application may possibly benefit from using adw ToolbarView widget.
The information may be displayed in AdwActionRow's with "property" class.
These features become available in version 1.4 of libadwaita.
I would wait until this version is released.
  
## TODO
  
- deploy to flathub
  - [ ] update screenshots
  - [ ] describe "system" on web page
  - [ ] build with flatpak
  - [ ] commit to flathub
- post to /r/linux? and hacker news and lemmy

- gi-object-show does not work on Gio.BusType enum?
- 
  This does not work, it halts:
  ```
  (use-modules (g-golf))
  (gi-import "GLib")
  (g-variant-new-string "hello")
  ```
  But with <code>(gi-import "Gio")</code> it works.
- g-variant-new-array is not possible to use?
- g-irepository-get-infos should work
- object info from g-irepository-get-info should have nice string representation

- gvariants should be handled better:
  - two functions to convert between a variant and scheme value
  - accept scheme values in place of gvariant arguments.

- g-golf browser?

- guile should print backtrace,
  in case the exception is thrown from a thread.

- report selection bug, see select.scm
